## Upadte on Sensor Development
 
The [sensor](https://openrecycling.com/en/projects/2021/01/06/plastic-type-sensor.html) prototype is fully assembled now. Also all hardware features are tested and work fine. 
Next steps will be development of the spectrum recording firmware and voltage control calibration. 
Excited to share the first labeled datasets by end of april.

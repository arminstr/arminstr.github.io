## We just released the GitHub repository for our Motor Controller!
 
It's a motor controller using a four full-bridge power switch integrated circuit. This way three and four-phased motors can be connected. The design allows communication via CAN, the connection of a differential 5V or 12V encoder, and a homing switch.
